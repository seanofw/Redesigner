Redesigner is a tool to generate and validate ASP.NET WebForms designer files.

# Overview

ASP.NET WebForms is a powerful website development framework, but the `.designer` files it requires can
be a pain to work with. They can often get broken, corrupted, or out-of-sync with the markup,
leading to complicated problems that are often difficult to resolve.

Redesigner is a command-line tool that can read and parse `.aspx` and `.ascx` files and generate
`.designer` files for them. It runs quickly and reliably, and can display lots of useful
information about how the `.designer` file was generated. It does not use or require Visual
Studio, either!

It has an open-source license (the New BSD license) and can be reused anywhere for nearly any
purpose, for free!
  
# Usage

Redesigner is a command-line tool, and is invoked like this:
  
    Redesigner.exe [-w website.dll] [-r path\to\root\of\website] [options] files.aspx ...

A simple use to regenerate a `.designer` file for `MyPage.aspx` might look like this:

    Redesigner.exe -w MyWebsite\bin\MyWebsite.dll -r MyWebsite MyWebsite\MyPage.aspx

**Note:**  Your website *must* be able to be compiled!  Redesigner *must* be able to
reflect against your website's DLL, so if you can't compile your website's DLL, do whatever
you have to do to hack your website until you can get it to compile.
	
Currently, Redesigner can generate `.designer.cs` files for `.aspx` and `.ascx` files.  It can
handle `<%@ Register %>` directives found in markup, and registered namespaces and user
controls found in your website's `web.config`.  It can handle server controls, user controls,
and HTML controls, data-bound controls and template controls, and complex nested control
properties.  It uses the same parsing regular expressions ASP.NET uses to ensure that it
will analyze your markup the same way that ASP.NET will.
  
Redesigner can process whole directories of `.ascx` and `.aspx` files simply by specifying a
directory name instead of just a `.aspx` or `.ascx` filename.  It will recursively search the
directory for all `.ascx` and `.aspx` files contained therein and will process all of them in a
batch.

# Generate Mode

In generate mode (the default mode), Redesigner will recreate one or more `.designer` files for
the given `.aspx` or `.ascx` input file.  Any existing `.designer` file will be replaced with one
that Redesigner generates based on the control declarations found in the markup.  The
formatting and structure matches Visual Studio's, and should be readable by Visual Studio.
  
Regenerating a `.designer` file for `MyPage.aspx` might look like this:

    Redesigner.exe -w MyWebsite\bin\MyWebsite.dll -r MyWebsite MyWebsite\MyPage.aspx
  
Regenerating `.designer` files for a whole directory tree might look like this:

    Redesigner.exe -w MyWebsite\bin\MyWebsite.dll -r MyWebsite MyWebsite
  
Generate mode will display detailed error messages when it finds an error while parsing and
analyzing a `.aspx` or `.ascx` file.  In addition, it will also set Redesigner's exit code to
describe the overall state of the generation task (see EXIT CODES below).

# Verify Mode

In verify mode, turned on with the `--verify` option, Redesigner will attempt to determine
whether existing `.designer` files are "correct" for their markup.  It checks the layout of the
file, whether the types match, whether all the control properties exist and are in the right
order, and even whether the curly braces are in the right places (relative to how Visual Studio
expects them).

A simple use to validate an existing .designer file for MyPage.aspx might look like this:

    Redesigner.exe --verify -w MyWebsite\bin\MyWebsite.dll -r MyWebsite MyWebsite\MyPage.aspx

Validating an entire directory tree of .designer files might look like this:
	
    Redesigner.exe --verify -w MyWebsite\bin\MyWebsite.dll -r MyWebsite MyWebsite

Verify mode will display detailed error messages when it finds an error in a .designer file.
In addition, it will also set Redesigner's exit code to describe the overall state of the
validation (see EXIT CODES below).
  
# Verbose Option

If you want detailed information about what Redesigner is doing, you can add the `--verbose`
option to the command-line.  This will cause Redesigner to print out a huge quantity of
text describing what it found in your markup, where it found the controls while reflecting,
and lots of useful information that may be valuable when tracking down errors in your markup.
The `--verbose` option prints a lot of text, but that's better than just saying "Exception of
type System.Exception was thrown", isn't it? :-)
  
# Quiet Options

Redesigner can generate a lot of output.  If you want it to only display text when it
encounters an error, and to omit all other text, add the `--quiet` option to the command-line.
  
# Exit Codes

Redesigner attempts to be helpful by setting its exit code to a meaningful value.  The exit
codes it uses are as follows:
  
  - 0:   Success: All tasks completed successfully.
	
  - 1:   Nothing to do: No `.aspx` or `.ascx` files were given on the command-line.
  - 2:   Help: The user requested help via the `-h` or `--help` command-line options.
  - 3:   Command-line error: The command-line is not well-formed or has incompatible options.
	
  - -1:  Failed generation: At least one of the `.designer` files that was to be generated failed
          because of errors in the markup.
  - -2:  Failed validation: At least one of the `.designer` files that was to be verified was
          either broken, internally inconsistent, or failed to match its associated markup.
  - -3:  Redesigner encountered an internal processing error and was forced to stop.
	
  Note that in some environments, the negative exit codes may become large positive numbers (for
  example, MS-DOS would turn -1 into 255).  To ensure scripts behave correctly, it is safest
  to test only that the exit code was zero (success) or nonzero (failure).
  
# Options

  - `--help`            Show help on usage and command-line options.

  - `--website website.dll`
  - `-w website.dll`    The path to the DLL that contains the website's
                    code-behind. [required]

  - `--root pathname`
  - `-r pathname`       Specify the path to the website's root, where the web.config
                    file is located. [required]

  - `--verify`          Verify that the existing designer file(s) were
                    generated correctly.

  - `--generate`        Generate replacement designer file(s) for the given
                    pages/controls. [default]

  - `--verbose`         Turn on verbose logging of page processing, which can help
                    locate and diagnose errors.

  - `--quiet`           Turn off all messages except errors.
  
# To-do

  Future plans may include:
  
  - Support for reading and processing `.master` files.

  - Generating and verifying `.designer.vb` files (not just `.designer.cs` files).

  - Creating a `Redesigner.dll` that can be reused in other applications.
	
  - Creating a right-click plugin for Visual Studio to allow Redesigner to generate and verify
    `.designer` files for individual pages as well as folders.
	   
  - Creating a "Repair-If-Needed" mode that regenerates .designer files only for those that
    fail verification.

# Bugs

  - Redesigner does not currently support controls that do clever things with `ControlBuilder`
    classes, such as using them to switch "obvious" types via `GetChildControlType()`.  Any
    custom controls that heavily use `ControlBuilder` may mis-compile.

  - Controls that have been moved from the `.designer` file to the code-behind will be
    considered "missing" in verify mode, and will be regenerated in the `.designer` file in
    generate-mode.  Redesigner has no way to know that the required control declarations
    were moved, and adding support for this is somewhere between "challenging" and
    "impossible".

  - Redesigner currently requires your website to be a compiled DLL.  It is theoretically
    possible to generate and verify using only the website's source code, but it's a
    nontrivial task to parse it on the fly to extract the class declarations and property
    names.  Support for this is possible but not currently planned.

# Credits

  - Redesigner was originally written by [Sean Werkema](https://github.com/seanofw) in October-December 2012.  I updated it to v1.1 in January 2013.
